TAYLOR: No one is listening to me.
TAYLOR: I can't calm down, I'm being persecuted.
ANDREW: We've been hearing you for 20 minutes.
TAYLOR: Well, excuse me, Andrew, but some of us have businesses to run that don't involve peddling drug paraphernalia to kids.
ANDREW: It was a lava lamp, Taylor.
TAYLOR: There is no use for a lava lamp unless you're on drugs.
ANDREW: Oh, for crying out loud.
LORELAI:  What'd I miss?
RORY:  Taylor Doose wants the no-parking zone in front of his store removed. He says his customers are being unfairly ticketed.
LORELAI:  No, it's just because he wants to park there all day.
RORY:  Genius.
MAYOR: I have been mayor of this fine town for a long time. I tend to think of all of you as my children. Unfortunately, sometimes children have to be disciplined. Now I'm going to say something and I'm only gonna say it once. . .we have leash laws, people.
LORELAI: Daddy's getting angry.
MAYOR: Rover will not leash himself.
RORY: Hm, good point.
LORELAI: Hm.
MAYOR: I would like to now move on to something of even greater importance. As you all know, this coming Friday is the anniversary of the legendary Battle of Stars Hollow. 
LORELAI:  Where's Luke?
RORY:  Up there.
MAYOR: Penny will be circulating a sign up sheet for those of you who would like to participate in the reenactment of foresaid battle.
RORY: He's turning red.
LORELAI: Oh, oh.
MAYOR: All right. It was a frigid November night, some 224 years ago.
LORELAI: He's shifting in his seat
MAYOR: The brave Stars Hollow militia stood in wait for the Red Coats.
RORY: He's adjusting the cap.
LORELAI: Ooh!
MAYOR: Tired and hungry, twelve proud men took their positions in the town's square, braving the elements. . .
LORELAI: He's fighting the urge, he's fighting the urge.
MAYOR: . . .and imminent death in their valiant efforts. . .
LUKE: Oh, for God's Sake, do we have to go through this every damn year!
LORELAI: Yes!
RORY: And the urge wins by a long shot!
LUKE: I thought we were here to discuss town issues.
TAYLOR: This is a town issue.
MAYOR: Excuse me, who's talking?
LUKE: It's me, Harry, Luke. You've known me since I was 5 years old.
MAYOR: Oh, Luke, yes. Sit down. Now as I was saying, twelve heroic men assembled with guns drawn ready to meet their maker.
LUKE: What are you talking about? Twelve guys stood in a row all night.
MAYOR: Waiting for the Red Coats.
LUKE: Who never showed!
MAYOR: Now just a minute!
LUKE: Twelve guys stood in a row all night waiting for an enemy that never showed. They got stood up. They should've been wearing prom dresses.
TAYLOR: I've had just about enough of this.
LUKE: Sit down, Taylor.
TAYLOR: Menace.
LUKE: Suck up.
LORELAI: Five bucks says somebody ends up in a headlock.
RORY: You're on!
LUKE: Have any of you ever considered the fact that you're glorifying a war we fought so we could keep land that we stole?
MAYOR: If you don't like it here in America, why don't you go stand in line for toilet paper in the USSR!
LUKE: There is no more USSR, Harry.
LORELAI: A sense of community is so important, isn't it?
RORY: It's what made our country great.
MAYOR: . . .that is a known fact, if you're so interested in facts!
MAX:  Lorelai, it's Max. . .Medina. Maaaax Medina. And once again we miss each other. It's now 2 o'clock in the afternoon on Thursday and I'm in my office grading a paper titled "Emily Dickinson: Get a life." Anyhow, as I sit here losing my faith in mankind, I wonder if we're ever gonna actually go on that date we talked about many moons ago. I teach a night class in Stamford twice a week, and when I pass that Stars Hollow sign on the turnpike, I think, out there is a beautiful woman that I someday hope to spend time with. Anyhow, I'm just thinking about you, and I don't know, maybe next week we can find some time. Goodbye Lorelai. . .Gilmore. You knew that. Okay, bye.  Lorelai, it's Max. . .Medina. Maaaax Medina.
RORY: Mom?
MAX: . . .And once again we miss each other. . . 
LORELAI: Sorry!
RORY: What are you doing up?
LORELAI: I couldn't sleep.
RORY: Its freezing in here. 
LORELAI: Wait, close your eyes and breathe.  I smell snow.
RORY: Ah, it's that time of year.
LORELAI: Can't you smell it?
RORY: You know, it's like dogs and high-pitched noises. I think it's something only you can smell.
LORELAI: I love snow.
RORY: Really, I had no idea.
LORELAI: Everything's magical when it snows, everything looks pretty. The clothes are great. Coats, scarves, gloves, hats.
RORY: Thermal underwear, wool socks, ear flaps.
LORELAI: Do you know that the best things in my life have happened when it snowed?
RORY: Why, yes, I do.
LORELAI: My best birthday.
RORY: Your first kiss.
LORELAI: Your first steps. They all happened when it snowed.
RORY: Feet. 
LORELAI: I feel good. Tingly.
RORY: That's called frostbite.
LORELAI: You are mocking your mother, the woman who birthed you.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: During a snowstorm, might I add.
RORY: So, how soon is it supposed to hit?
LORELAI: Hm. Tomorrow. . .definitely tomorrow.
RORY: Okay, then, tomorrow it is.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: You, me, donuts, coffee, standing out in a snowstorm.
LORELAI: At midnight?
RORY: At midnight.
LORELAI: You are my favorite daughter.
RORY: So, how many times are you gonna listen to that?
LORELAI: 'Til it stops being sexy.
RORY: Stop! That's my teacher you're talking about. I have to respect him.
LORELAI: Okay, well, if it makes you feel any better, while he's being sexy, he's also being grammatically correct.
RORY: Better. Thank you.
LORELAI: Sorry I woke you up.
RORY: That's okay. It's all fodder for the tell-all. Goodnight.
LORELAI: Goodnight.
MAX:  Lorelai, it's Max. . .Medina. Maaaax Medina. . .
LORELAI: Hey, how is it out there?
MICHEL: It is cold and gray like a fat dead pigeon.
LORELAI: Ah, we'll need to pull out the sleds, people might want to sled. Ooh, and the parkas, we'll need the parkas.
MICHEL: For what?
LORELAI: In case anyone wants to hike.
MICHEL: You do know that not everyone finds the idea of being pelted with frozen water appealing.
LORELAI: I know, and how sad for them.
MICHEL: The thrilling sensation of getting lost in a blizzard, of freezing to death in the woods, and having to eat your friend's buttocks to stay alive, that is lost on many people.
LORELAI: I am telling you, five minutes in a snowball fight, we could knock that stick right out of your butt.
SOOKIE: Okay, how does this sound? Maple sugar snowflakes on all the pillows.
LORELAI: Oh, that's sounds wonderful!
MICHEL: Make them in the shape of a buttock, get people used to them.
SOOKIE: Okay, is that a real suggestion?
LORELAI: Sookie, please, who is speaking?
SOOKIE: Michel, right, okay. Snowflakes it is.
LANE: I just can't believe it. I mean, I sat next to him at practice for months, and then one day I look over and it's Rich. Rich Bloomingfeld.
RORY: Where is my chemistry book? I had it at your house yesterday, didn't I?
LANE: Rory, focus, please.
RORY: I'm sorry. I just can't find my book.
LORELAI: Hey babe. Sergeant pepper.
RORY: Mom, do you know where my. . .
LORELAI: Big scary chemistry book is? Behind the desk.
RORY: Oh, thank God. 
LORELAI: Wow.
LANE: Yeah.
RORY: So, is Sookie in the kitchen?
LORELAI: And there she'll stay. 
RORY: Okay, so where were we?
LANE: I just met my soul mate.
RORY: Right, Rich Bloomingfeld. Does he still wear the Star Trek shirt?
SOOKIE: Now, remember, you do not take your eyes off this for a minute 'cause the second you do, it will boil and then it's ruined. So, just stand there and stare at it, okay?
RORY: Hey Sookie.
SOOKIE: Hey kitty cats. Cinnamon buns are over there.
RORY: Do you have any of those rocky road cookies that you made yesterday?
SOOKIE: I can scrounge some up. Lane, you need a bag?
LANE: No, thank you.
SOOKIE:  You staring?
CHEF: I'm staring.
SOOKIE: Thank you. 
LANE: So, anyhow, Rich has this amazing hair.
RORY: Really?
LANE: Oh my God, it's so perfect. It's thick but it's not too thick, and it's got really good natural wave, so he probably uses way less product than most guys.
RORY: Always a plus. Hey, what time is it?
LANE: I don't know
RORY: I have to get to the bus stop. Dean's meeting me there.
LANE: But I'm trying to talk to you about this.
RORY: I know, we'll talk on the way.
SOOKIE: Here you go.
RORY: Thank you, Sookie.
LORELAI: Hey, sweets. I have a locksmith coming to the house today like five-ish, and I don't know how long it'll take, so will you tell Grandma and Grandpa that I'm gonna be late, and that I'm having Satan's baby. You pick the order.
RORY: I'll relay the time message but I'm leaving the rest up to you.
LORELAI: What is this? You hate rocky road cookies.
RORY: I do not. 
LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry. That must be my other daughter, Schmory.
RORY: We're leaving now.
LORELAI: Wait a minute. I know who likes rocky road cookies.
SOOKIE: Who?
LORELAI: Dean. They're for Dean.
SOOKIE: She's bringing baked goods to a boy. Wow, serious!
LORELAI:  Here Dean, these cookies are for you, 'cause you're keen.
RORY: Stop.
SOOKIE: Rory's in love!
LORELAI: Love, love, love, Dean, Dean, Dean!
SOOKIE:  Cookies for the love and the Dean and the cookies for the love and the Dean and the cookies for the love and the . . .
LORELAI:  Dean and the love and the Dean and the love and the Dean and the love. . .
LORELAI: Okay, we can stop, she's gone now.
SOOKIE: But it's fun.
LORELAI: Well, you're on your own.
SOOKIE:  The cookies for the Dean and the Rory and the cookies for the love with the Dean. . .
LANE: I just can't believe it. I mean, I've known him since the sixth grade, but suddenly he's different. He's not gangly anymore. You remember how gangly he was?
RORY: I'm sorry, what?
LANE: You're not listening to me.
RORY: I am, I'm sorry. I just couldn't find my bookmark. Okay, go ahead.
LANE: Okay, here are the problems facing the whole Bloomingfeld-Kim situation.
RORY: One, hyphenation would be a pain.
LANE: Two, he's my band partner. Romance would be completely awkward. Three, he's never even looked at me like I'm a girl or something resembling one.  Four, there's no way I could convince my parents he was Korean. But I can't help it, I'm obsessed. Did I tell you about his hair?
RORY: It's on his head, right?
DEAN: Hi.
RORY: Hi.
DEAN: Lane.
LANE: Dean.
DEAN: Nice hat.  Here.
RORY: Oh, how'd you like it?
DEAN: Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
RORY: Aha! You liked it, you liked Jane Austen. I knew you would. Lane, Dean likes Jane Austen.
LANE: Wow, who would've thought.
RORY: I told him he would, but he was all, 'Forget Jane Austen, you have to read Hunter Thompson.'
DEAN: You do have to read Hunter Thompson.
RORY: Not as much as you needed to read Jane Austen.
DEAN: Yeah, yeah. Hey, what's that? 
RORY: Just some cookies.
DEAN: Rocky road.
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: Wow, she brings me cookies. How can I repay her?
RORY: How about a little Charlotte Bronte?
DEAN: How about something else? 
RORY: That's good, too.
LANE: Okay, I gotta go. I am gonna be late for homeroom, and I have that perfect attendance certificate in my sights.
RORY: See you later.
LANE: Yeah, see ya.
LORELAI: Ladies and gentlemen, we have flakes. Flakes have been sighted. Flakage, if you will, has begun.  Michel, it's the first snowfall of the season. It's very lucky. Make a wish.
MICHEL: Get away from me.
LORELAI: Oh, you're not supposed to say it out loud.
MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking.
LORELAI: The world changes when it snows. It gets quiet. Everything softens.
MICHEL:  It's your mother.
LORELAI: And then the rain comes.  Hi, Mom.
EMILY: Have you seen the news?
LORELAI: Ever?
EMILY: A bad storm is heading your way. It's already hitting us here.
LORELAI: Well, don't panic. I'll get the ark, you get the animals.
EMILY: I just sent Lance to pick up Rory at school. The roads are terrible, black ice everywhere, it's just a mess out there. I hate this kind of weather. So, anyhow, what time will you get here?
LORELAI: Well, uh, gee, Mom, I don't know, let me see. Black ice, treacherous roads. . . I guess I'll just put on my red, white, and blue leotard, grab my golden lasso and fly the invisible plane on over.
EMILY: You're not coming?
LORELAI: Well, if it's as bad as you say it is, I don't see how I'd get there.
EMILY: Well, I guess it'll just be the three of us then.
LORELAI: I guess so.
EMILY: And you know, Rory should probably spend the night tonight also.
LORELAI: Okay.
EMILY: And if it's still bad tomorrow. . .
LORELAI: Mom, why don't you wait and see what the weather does before you fill out a change of address card for her.
RORY: Hey, Grandma.
EMILY: Rory's here.
LORELAI: Put her on a sec.
EMILY:  Rory, it's your mother.
RORY:  Hey.
LORELAI: Hi. Things bad out there, huh?
RORY: It's crazy. There's snow coming down everywhere, and let me just tell you, saddle shoes are not the best all-weather footwear.
LORELAI: Aw, you fell.
RORY: Twice.
LORELAI: Yikes. I'm sorry.
RORY: So what's the deal? Are you coming over tonight?
LORELAI: No, I guess I'm pretty much stuck in the Hollow tonight.
RORY: Bummer. Well, we can take our snow walk tomorrow night?
LORELAI: Absolutely. All right, now, honey, tell Grandma that you arrived there not a member of the Junior League, I'd like you to leave there the same way.
RORY: Call if you get lonely.
LORELAI: I will. Bye.
LUKE: Harry, come on, stop this before somebody drives through town and thinks the local mental institution has bad padlocks.
HARRY: Luke, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Your father was a reenactor.
LUKE: Yes, and I thought he was crazy also.
TAYLOR: Who's stepping on my musket?
KIRK: That'd be me.
TAYLOR: Well, stop it.
LORELAI: There goes the fire chief, the police chief and the one paramedic with a valid license. I feel safe, don't you?
LUKE: Look at them, all relatively intelligent men, but there they are dressed up in costumes, standing out in a snowstorm, and for what?
LORELAI: Because it's tradition.
LUKE: Tradition is a trap, it allows people to stick their head in the sand. Everything in the past was so quaint, so charming. Times were simpler. Kids didn't have sex. Neighbors knew each other. It's a freaking fairy tale. Things sucked then, too. It just sucked without indoor plumbing.
LORELAI: I think some traditions are nice. Birthdays. Holidays. Taking a walk in the first snow of the season.
LUKE: I didn't get the Hallmark card for that one.
LORELAI: When I was five, I had a really bad ear infection and I had been home in bed for a week and I was very sad. So I wished really hard that something wonderful would happen to me, and I woke up the next morning and it had snowed. And I was sure that some fairy godmother had done it just for me. It was my little present.
LUKE: Your parents never explained the concept of weather to you?
LORELAI: I am making a point, Mouthy McGee. Of course, many years later, I realized that logically, the snow was not there for me personally. But, still, when it snows, something inside me says, 'hey, that's your present.' I don't think it'll ever change.
LUKE: My father used to be one of those guys.
LORELAI: Yeah?
LUKE: Yeah, he even had his own musket.
LORELAI: Really?
LUKE: Never had to rent it.
LORELAI: Where is the musket now?
LUKE: He was buried with it.
LORELAI: Wow.
LUKE: Yup. He loved that musket.
LORELAI: That's nice. . .in a disturbing sort of way.
LUKE: Come on in, I'll get you some coffee.
LORELAI: No, thanks. I'm gonna walk around. Enjoy my present a little.
LANE: Oh.
LORELAI: I smell snow.
MAX: Well, well, well.
LORELAI: What's up, Teach?
MAX: What are you doing here?
LORELAI: I live here. What are you doing here?
MAX: I was on my way back from Stamford, and my car decided to stop.
LORELAI: Here?
MAX: Yes.
LORELAI: In my town?
MAX: Yes.
LORELAI: Good car.
MAX: It's nice to see you.
LORELAI: You, too.
MAX: You know, a minute ago, I was really angry about something and now I just can't remember what it was.
LORELAI: Well, that's snow for you.
MAX: I guess so.
LORELAI: So, this is quite a predicament you're in. Stranded here in a strange town with no one you know. Oh, wait. . .
MAX: Where's Rory tonight?
LORELAI: She's in Hartford with her grandparents.
MAX: That must be nice.
LORELAI: Whatever you say.
MAX: So, Rory's in Hartford.
LORELAI: Yes.
MAX: And I'm in Stars Hollow.
LORELAI: Correct.
MAX: And you are. . .
LORELAI: Trying to figure out where I should take you.
MAX: No, no, no, no, where I should take you.
LORELAI: This is my town. You know nothing around here.
MAX: No, but I was the one who asked you out initially, so therefore I am still obligated to do the taking.
LORELAI: Yes, but I was the one who did the canceling after you did the asking, therefore you forfeit your taking rights to me, the canceler.
MAX: So we're actually gonna do this?
LORELAI: Yes, we are.
MAX: Let me just give this guy my keys and then we'll go.
LORELAI: Great.
MAX: Great's an understatement.
EMILY:  Well, I just don't understand why you waited so late to call. . . Are you sure? . . . Fine. . .All right, yes, goodbye.  Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do now.
RICHARD: What's the problem, Emily?
EMILY: The problem is that apparently Florence cannot get here because of the storm.
RICHARD: Florence?
EMILY: Our cook.
RICHARD: Ah. Well, we'll just have to go out then.
EMILY: Oh, please, Richard, pay attention. We can't go out. It's miserable out there.
RICHARD: Well, we'll figure something out then.
EMILY: What? What will we figure out?
RICHARD: Well, I don't know, but. . .
EMILY: I hate the damn snow.
RICHARD: Emily, calm down.
EMILY: This is a serious problem. These Friday dinners are the only proper food that child eats all week.
RICHARD: Rory, are you in any way malnourished or in need of some international relief organization to recruit a celebrity to raise money on your account?
RORY: I'm good.
RICHARD: She's good, Emily.
EMILY: Your sense of humor rears its ugly head at the oddest of times, Richard.
RICHARD: Emily, I am not the mastermind behind some great scheme to spoil your dinner plans and I don't care to be treated as such.
EMILY: So you're fine with having no dinner tonight, is that it?
RICHARD: I certainly am not.
RORY: Hey, how about I check the fridge? I'm sure there's something in there we could whip up.
EMILY: Whip up?
RORY: Yeah, come on. It'll be fun, I promise.
EMILY: Well, come on, Mr. We'll Figure it Out.
EMILY: Nothing.
RICHARD: Not a blessed thing.
RORY: Hey, there's frozen pizza.
EMILY: How in the world did that get there?
RORY: Maybe you bought it and forgot about it.
EMILY: I have never bought frozen pizza. It must belong to Anna.
RICHARD: The maid.
EMILY: Yes.
RICHARD: Ah, got one.
EMILY: What are you doing?
RORY: I'm gonna make it.
EMILY: Oh, Rory, you're not serious.
RICHARD: That hardly looks like dinner.
EMILY: I agree. Rory, that's food you eat at a carnival, or in a Turkish prison.
RORY: I promise you're gonna love it.
EMILY: But. . .
RORY: Listen, just leave it up to me. You guys go back into the living room and I'll call you when it's ready.  Hey, Grandma?
EMILY: Yes?
RORY: What are the odds of you knowing where a cookie sheet would be?
RICHARD: I'd say very slim.
RORY: Never mind. I'll find it.
EMILY: Very slim? Thank you for that.
LORELAI: Thank you. Hold that. 
MAX: Yup.
LORELAI: Thanks.
MAX: Thanks.
LORELAI: God, it's a beautiful night, huh?
MAX: Yes, it is.
LORELAI: So, tell me something about yourself.
MAX: Like what?
LORELAI: Uh, have you ever been married?
MAX: Nope.
LORELAI: Ever been close?
MAX: Once.
LORELAI: And?
MAX: She's in Thailand now.
LORELAI: Sex trade?
MAX: Bank of America.
LORELAI: Well, it's usually either one or the other.
MAX: She went there on business, she did well, she never came back.
LORELAI: Oh, sad.
MAX: Well, it was at the time, but if it was meant to be. . .
LORELAI: Ah, he believes in fate.
MAX: Fate, poetry, love. . .they all go together, don't they?
LORELAI: Yes, they do.
MAX: How about you?
LORELAI: Oh, I've never been married.
MAX: Ever been close?
LORELAI: Uh, Rory's dad proposed.
MAX: What happened?
LORELAI: The bell rang? I was late for chem lab?
MAX: You ever sorry that you didn't?
LORELAI: Oh, no. We were so young, and my life would've been completely different. You know, I wouldn't live here, I wouldn't work here, I wouldn't be walking here with you.
MAX: Where are we going?
LORELAI: You'll see.
MAX: Are we gonna get there before we freeze?
LORELAI: Now, what kind of fun would it be if I told you the answer?
MAX: You're crazy.
LORELAI: Very possible
MAX: And I'm following you.
LORELAI: Yes, you are.
MAX: So possibly I'm crazier than you are.
LORELAI: Again, very possible.
MAX: A match made in heaven.
LORELAI: Or in Bellevue.
MAX: Must be fate.
RICHARD:  Oh, this is getting ridiculous Aaron. . . I will not continue to have these conversations with a child . . . Yes, he is a child. . .Well, when he's worked 30 years at the company, that's when he's not a child. Until then I don't care what his opinions are . . . Aaron, are you listening to me? Good, because I'm hanging up on you now, and I wanted to make sure that you heard it.  What a moron.
RORY: Hello?
LANE: Rory?
RORY: Lane?
LANE: Where are you?
RORY: I'm at my grandparents. What are you doing at my house?
LANE: Like you care.
RORY: What are you talking about?
LANE: You're never around when I need you.
RORY: Well, you know I have to go to my grandparents on Fridays.
LANE: I know. You go to your grandparents. You go to Chilton. You have to meet Dean. He needs his cookies. I can't find my books.
RORY: What are you talking about?
LANE: What good is it to have a best friend when she's never around and she never listens and she has no interest in the fact that you're in love or that you touched his hair?
RORY: You touched whose hair?
LANE: Rich. . .Bloomingfeld.
RORY: Why would you touch Rich Bloomingfeld's hair?
LANE: Why? That's a good question. I don't know why. Why would a sane person do a thing like that? Maybe I'm not sane. Maybe I'm going through some sort of phase. Maybe I really, really needed someone to talk to about this and you weren't there.
RORY: Lane, come on.
LANE: No, you come on. You're always at school or you're talking about school or you're with Dean. You have everything now and I have nothing except for 2000 Korean bibles and a potential 'F' in jazz band.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LANE: Don't be sorry, be here.
RORY: I . . .Lane? Are you there?
LANE: Rory? Rory?
RORY: Lane?
EMILY: There you are.
RORY: I think the phones went dead.
EMILY: It's probably just this horrible storm. You must come downstairs immediately.
RORY: What's wrong?
EMILY: The stove is buzzing.
RORY: It's just the timer, Grandma.
EMILY: I know it's the timer, Rory. What I don't know is where it's located or how to turn it off.
RORY: But I really need to call Lane back.
EMILY: There's nothing you can do now. The phones will come back on eventually. Now, please come downstairs and help me stop the buzzing.
RORY: But. . .
RICHARD:  Oh, Emily, for heaven's sake, get down here!
RORY: Okay, let's go.
LORELAI: So, the fiesta burger. . .
MAX: Very interesting.
LORELAI: Very spicy.
MAX: Oh yeah.
LORELAI: How's your tongue?
MAX: Much better, thank you.
LORELAI: Are you scared yet?
MAX: Not yet.
LORELAI: Are you scared yet?
MAX: I'm still good.
LORELAI: Are you scared yet?
MAX: You know, you're very annoying in a movie.
LORELAI: I know. I think it's very important that you know my faults as well as my many attributes.
MAX: Very thoughtful of you.
LORELAI: It is, isn't it?
MAX: Because as you know, you could get very carried away by your many attributes, suddenly find yourself thinking, my God, this woman is absolutely perfect.
LORELAI: We wouldn't want that now, would we?
MAX: No, we wouldn't. 
RORY: You wanna eat it before it gets cold.  How is it?
EMILY: Not cold!
RICHARD: Mm, it's quite tasty. Emily, we should have this more often.
EMILY: What?
RICHARD: Perhaps instead of that horrible salmon that keeps showing up.
EMILY: That salmon is a fine delicacy.
RICHARD: Mm, potato, po-tah-to.
RORY: Try it again, Grandma. It's probably cooler now.
EMILY: No, thank you, I'm fine.
RORY: You know what? It's really good if you add some extra Parmesan to it.  This is Mom's special trick. Frozen pizza is a staple at our house. Mom's become a major doctoring genius. She'll put anything on it. One time Sookie came and brought us some foie gras, and Mom stuck it on a pizza.
EMILY: How was it?
RORY: Pretty good once we took the foie gras off. Okay, that's good. Try it. Please. If you wanna get really crazy, you can pick it up.
EMILY: Well, all right. Here goes nothing.  Mmm! That's wonderful!
RORY: See?
EMILY: Rory, pass me that cheese.  Trust me, it makes all the difference.
RORY: I'll be right back.  I found this in Mom's room.
EMILY: What's that?
RORY: Pictures.
EMILY: Oh, my goodness. I haven't seen that in years.
RICHARD: Oh, my gosh.
EMILY: Ah, look at this
RORY: That's one fluffy white dress.
EMILY: Yes. There were 12 petticoats underneath it. We got it in London, remember, Richard?
RICHARD: Mm.
RORY: She looks like a little princess
EMILY: Yes, well, if memory serves, I believe about two minutes after that picture was taken, her highness dumped a glass of grape juice all over it.
RICHARD: Look, Emily, it's Hopie.
RORY: Hopie?
EMILY: My younger sister.
RORY: Has she ever been here when I was here? I don't remember her.
RICHARD: Oh, she lives in Paris. Our great expatriate.
EMILY: Oh, my, Hopie, look at you. I haven't seen her in such a long time.
RICHARD: Maybe we should take a trip this year.
EMILY: That would be nice.
RICHARD: Maybe Rory could go with us.
RORY: I'll start packing tomorrow. Oh, is that you guys?
RICHARD: Yes, it is.
EMILY: That is our wedding picture.
RORY: It's an amazing dress.
EMILY: It should've been. My mother had three seamstresses working around the clock making it.
RORY: Do you still have it?
EMILY: It's upstairs packed away somewhere. I'll save it for you if you like.
RICHARD: Oh, Emily, Rory's too young to be thinking about things like that.
EMILY: Oh, Richard, please. Every young girl thinks about her wedding. I know I did. I knew from the time I was twelve that I wanted lilies and orchids with a silver bow wrapped around them for my bouquet.
RICHARD: You also knew that you wanted to marry Erol Flynn.
RORY: Really? Grandma had a thing for the pirate guy?
EMILY: I did not have a thing for the pirate guy.
RICHARD: She was mad about him. She even tried to get me to grow one of those little mustaches.
RORY: You're kidding.
EMILY: Richard, stop.
RICHARD: She wanted me to swing from a chandelier.
EMILY: Oh, now you're just being silly.
RICHARD: Luckily I was on the fencing team in college or I would've married Lucinda Lester by now.
EMILY: Actually, Lucinda Lester looked a lot like Erol Flynn. I should've married her, it would've been very modern of me.
RORY: Wow. Mom looks really beautiful here.
EMILY: Yes, she does.
RORY: What was the occasion?
RICHARD: Who would like some coffee?
EMILY: That was her debutante gown for her coming out party.
RORY: Mom had a coming out party?
RICHARD: No, she didn't.
RORY: Oh.
EMILY: Yes, well, things happen, don't they?
RICHARD: If you'll excuse me, I have some business calls to make.
EMILY: I'll go get that coffee.
LUKE: Here.
HARRY: What is this?
LUKE: I brought you coffee.
HARRY: No, thank you.
LUKE: Harry, you're freezing. Take the damn coffee.
HARRY: When our forefathers stood out here many moons ago, they didn't have any coffee.
LUKE: How do you know? Do you have written documentation about what sort of beverages they did or did not have on that long historic night of standing?
HARRY: This is still a joke to you, young man. I don't choose to be a joke. We don't need your coffee.
LUKE: Harry, please, take the coffee. My father would've taken the coffee.
HARRY: Well, all right then, thank you.
LUKE: Andrew?
ANDREW: Thank you, Luke.
LUKE: Kirk?
KIRK: You got any herbal tea?
LUKE: Uh, not on me, but I can get some.
KIRK: With a squeeze of lemon?
LUKE: Okay.
LUKE: Okay, okay, hang on a minute. One herbal tea, uh, and two cocoas.
MAX: Yeah, that part was a little slow.
LORELAI: Slow?
MAX: But it picked up pretty soon after that, don't you think?
LORELAI: So, this is it, my house.
MAX: It's nice
LORELAI: Thank you.
MAX: Good porch. Nice windows. Front door. Which opens, I assume.
LORELAI: Yeah.
MAX: Something wrong?
LORELAI: No, nothing's wrong.
MAX: Are you sure?
LORELAI: Uh, yeah. I, um. . .see, I was so excited about the snow and about seeing you. . .
MAX: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome. That I didn't really think this thing out, and, uh, I usually think this kind of thing out, so I'm just thinking this thing out.
MAX: What thing?
LORELAI: Inviting a man over to my house.
MAX: Okay.
LORELAI: See, I have really strict rules about dating. I keep my personal life totally separate from my life with Rory. You know, I never want her to feel unsettled or like her life could just shift at any moment.
MAX: I totally understand.
LORELAI: And she comes first, and this is her house too and. . .
MAX: I understand. This is something that you don't do often.
LORELAI: Ever.
MAX: Ever?
LORELAI: Never.
MAX: I see.
LORELAI: I mean, I've dated, and, uh, you know, dated, but, um, I've just never dated. . . here in our house.
MAX: What if I promised you that if you let me in, all I'm expecting is a cup of coffee, that's it. Nothing weird or funny. Unless, of course, you're into weird and funny. . .
LORELAI: Max!
MAX: 'Cause I can do weird and funny. Lorelai, I've been enjoying the hell out of myself tonight, and I think you are, too.
LORELAI: I am.
MAX: Well, so, it's, uh, snowing, cold, and your daughter is elsewhere.
LORELAI: I know. I know.
MAX: I mean, the whole night's been a weird kismet of events.
LORELAI: Oh, it's that fate guy again.
MAX: At some point in your life you're gonna have to decide that some guy is worth opening that front door for. I am just volunteering.
LORELAI: Would you like some coffee?
LORELAI: How strong do you like your coffee, because I've built up such a tolerance to it I usually make it too intense for most people.
MAX: Yeah, yeah. I've lived through the fiesta burger, don't hold back now.
LORELAI: Okay.
MAX: Can I help?
LORELAI: Um, yeah, you can fill up the pot.
MAX: Oh, I'm very good at that. Six cups sounds good?
LORELAI: Fine, what are you gonna have?
MAX: You do know that was a leading question, right?
LORELAI: Really, how so?  How badly do you want that coffee?
MAX: Not that badly.
LORELAI: Such a good answer.
MAX: How many kids did you say you have?
LORELAI: One. Why?  Lane! Hi, hi. Wha. . .uh. . .we're just. . .what are. . .what are. . .what are you doing here?
LANE: I'm sorry, I was waiting for Rory. I'll just go back into her room and I won't come back out, I promise.
LORELAI: Oh, that's The Cure. I have to go back in there.
MAX: It's okay, I'll finish up the coffee.
LORELAI: I'll be back as fast as humanly possible.
MAX: Good.
LORELAI: Hey.
LANE: Sorry I messed up your date.
LORELAI: Ah, you didn't mess up my date. What's going on?
LANE: I was waiting for Rory to get home.
LORELAI: Sweetie, Rory's stuck in Hartford tonight.
LANE: Oh, I didn't know. I'll just go.
LORELAI: Hey, do you wanna talk? I'm not Rory, but we do use the same blow dryer.
LANE: I did something really stupid today.
LORELAI: Okay, what'd you pierce?
LANE: Nothing. I touched a boy's hair.
LORELAI: Okay.
LANE: A boy I really like.
LORELAI: So far, missing the stupid part.
LANE: I kind of did it without his permission.
LORELAI: Now we're getting somewhere.
LANE: I don't know what happened. I mean, I was just standing there and then he bends over and his hair falls forward and suddenly it's like my hand has a life of its own.
LORELAI: Sounds like your hand had a little help from your hormones.
LANE: God, I'm so humiliated. I can't ever go back to school. I'll have to be home schooled. My mother finally gets her way.
LORELAI: Look at it from a different perspective. You have so many years of screw-ups ahead of you. . .view this as a trial run for really grownup humiliation.
LANE: So not helping.
LORELAI: Maybe you should be a hairdresser.
LANE: Lorelai!
LORELAI: Yes, it's perfect. Then you can run your hands though anybody's hair you want and they'll pay you for it.
LANE: What am I going to do? I mean, everyone at school's gonna be talking about me. I can't show my face.
LORELAI: Everybody does stupid things in high school, it's like a requirement.
LANE: Not like this.
LORELAI: No, some people get pregnant. Talk about something really juicy for the gossip mill.
LANE: I forgot about that.
LORELAI: Yeah. Everybody screws up, Lane. That's what happens. It's what you do with the screw-ups, it's how you handle the experience - that's what you should judge yourself by. I have a great life and an amazing kid. And I took a detour, I ended up some place good.
LANE: Yeah.
LORELAI: Tell me this - how did his hair feel? As good as it looked?
LANE: Better.
LORELAI: Oh, you're gonna be fine. I'm positive about that.
LANE: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
LANE: So, who's the guy?
LORELAI: Rory's teacher.
LANE: Oh, he has nice hair.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LORELAI: Hey.
MAX: Hey. Everything okay in there?
LORELAI: It will be.
MAX: So where did we leave off?
LORELAI: Oh, Lane is gonna stay here tonight. She had a really bad teen day and she needs to crash someplace sympathetic.
MAX: Okay, I understand.
LORELAI: I swear to God, if this wasn't a major Judy Blume moment, I would kick her cute little butt right out of here.
MAX: Can you recommend a hotel that's really, really close to here?
LORELAI: Why don't you just stay here tonight? Everybody else is.
MAX: Oh, I don't know.
LORELAI: Really, the couch is comfortable, and there's pillows and blankets, and the bathroom's through there. The kitchen has nothing in it but running water if you get thirsty and. . .it's an awful night.
MAX: Okay, if it's not a problem.
LORELAI: Not at all.
MAX: Could I at least give you a kiss goodnight?
LORELAI: Only if you intend to live 'til morning.
MAX: Goodnight.
LORELAI: Goodnight.
LORELAI: Hi.
RORY: Hi. What's up?
LORELAI: Nothing, what's up with you?
RORY: You have something to tell me.
LORELAI: Boy, you're so smart. Right, okay, here we go. . .I've got a boy in the house.
RORY: You what?
LORELAI: Nothing happened, I swear. He slept the whole night on the couch. And you know him.
RORY: I do?
LORELAI: And you like him. I don't know if that's relevant, I just thought that I would throw that in there.
RORY: It's Mr. Medina.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: My English teacher is on my couch.
LORELAI: It was the snow. You know how I get, it's like catnip. I was walking, he was there, his car was broken, we had fiesta burgers. It was the snow. Rory, say something.
LORELAI: Rory, talk to me. How do you feel?
RORY: I don't know.
LORELAI: Take a guess. Angry, frustrated, nauseous?
RORY: Weird, I feel weird. Has he been here all night?
LORELAI: Pretty much.
RORY: Oh, my God. Did he go into the bathroom? I have stuff hanging in there!
LORELAI: Honey, you knew I was gonna date him, right? This isn't a total surprise.
RORY: Yes, I knew you were gonna date. I just didn't expect for him to be here . . at our house. . .in the morning.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: I don't remember ever there being a man in our house.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, I kind of broke the rules.
RORY: God, why is this so weird for me?
LORELAI: Because I should've told you first.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Because I should have talked to you before I did this.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Because you're afraid he smushed the couch pillows out of shape?
RORY: Do you love him?
LORELAI: I, uh. . .we had one date. It was a great date, World Series level. But it was just a date. Honey, I promised myself a long time ago that I was gonna keep all this stuff separate from you, and I want you to know that that still stands, okay? This was a one-time thing. I'm not gonna start just bringing guys home. This is not a trend.
RORY: You can, you know.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Bring guys home. I mean, if you like someone you should feel comfortable doing that.
LORELAI: I appreciate that.
RORY: I want you to be happy.
LORELAI: And I love you for that.
RORY: Plus, I know you're not a cat person, so you truly will be alone if you don't find someone.
LORELAI: Okay, look, someday I will bring somebody home, but when I do I just want to be sure it's the guy.
RORY: Mr. Medina's not the guy?
LORELAI: I don't know, he might be. But right now it's just you and me.  And sometimes Lane.
LANE: Hey.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: I'm gonna go wake the man up.
LANE: Your mom let me spend the night here.
RORY: I tried calling you back all night but the phones didn't turn back on until this morning.
LANE: It's okay, I understand.
RORY: Lane, I'm so sorry. I've been the worst friend lately.
LANE: No, I just wigged out a little. I get jealous sometimes. I mean, you seem to have this really great life going and I don't really fit in there.
RORY: That's not true, you totally fit in.
LANE: Yeah?
RORY: I'm talking Legos.
LANE: I hope so.
RORY: I will be better from now on, I promise. Twenty-four hours a day at your disposal.
LANE: Dean'll love that.
RORY: Well, he'll have to, you came first.
LANE: That's right. I got dibs.  Okay, I have to go home.
RORY: Coffee at Luke's, 2 o'clock?
LANE: You're on.
RORY: And I wanna hear all about that hair touching incident.
LANE: Yeah, and I wanna hear the rest of the teacher on the couch incident.
RORY: Deal.
