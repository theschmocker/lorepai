LORELAI: So where'd you say Dad was?
EMILY: Away on business.
LORELAI: Location's top secret?
EMILY: Oh, Germany.
LORELAI: Germany. Is Dad's firm insuring Nazis now?
EMILY: Your father doesn't know any Nazis.
LORELAI: I know, Mom. I was just --
EMILY: What?
RORY: Joking. She was joking.
EMILY: Oh. Hard to tell.
LORELAI: Yeah, well.
EMILY: Oh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Claudia died.
LORELAI: Who?
EMILY: Claudia. Your cousin Claudia. (Lorelai stares.) Claudia!
LORELAI: I'm hearing the name, Mom. I have no idea who that is.
EMILY: Claudia's your cousin, for all intents and purposes.
LORELAI: Oh, now we're getting to it.
EMILY: She was your father's grandmother's sister's girl. So to you, that would make her --
LORELAI: Nothing?
EMILY: Regardless the funeral's on Thursday. I thought we'd all go together.
LORELAI: Ooh, whoa. Two problems. Impossible to get away from the inn Thursday. Two, I've never met this woman.
EMILY: You most certainly have.
LORELAI: When?
EMILY: Several times.
LORELAI: I'll take one.
EMILY: We went to her house in Groton to see the first moon landing. She'd just gotten a new Philco.
LORELAI: I have no memory of this whatsoever.
EMILY: Rory, correct me if I'm wrong, but men have walked on the moon regardless of whether your mother remembers it or not.
RORY: That's the rumor.
LORELAI: I know men have walked on the moon. I just don't know Claudia.
EMILY: So you're not going?
LORELAI: Not this time.
EMILY: I don't think Claudia's planning to die a second time.
LORELAI: Mom, I couldn't go if I wanted to.
EMILY: Fine. (pauses) Oh wait -- Rudolph Gottfried.
LORELAI: Another cousin?
EMILY: No, a Nazi that we knew. I'd forgotten. We stayed with him once in Munich. Nice old man. Interesting stories.
LORELAI: Mom you socialized with a Nazi? That's despicable! That's heinous!
EMILY: No, dear, that was a joke.
LORELAI: Hey. I have an idea for a new reality show. How about everyone just looks out their freakin' kitchen window for a change?
RORY: Ooh. She's cranky this morning.
LORELAI: Let's just say the world has a formidable opponent.
RORY: Wait -- shouldn't you be baking?
LORELAI: I don't know. Shouldn't you be knitting?
RORY: Mom! The Chilton bake sale is today!
LORELAI: I know. I got it covered.
RORY: They expect the things to be homemade.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: By someone other than Dolly Madison.
LORELAI: I said I have it covered.
RORY: All of the parents pitch in so this is really really important. You know that, right?
LORELAI: No, I didn't know that. In that case I don't have it covered. I have it covered! Get your stuff and hit the stereo -- we're late.
RORY: (softly) It's not me.
LORELAI: (to Lane) Where does your mother think you are?
LANE: Oh, on a park bench contemplating the reunification of the two Koreas.
LORELAI: Not here, skanking to Rancid?
LANE: Wouldn't be included.
LORELAI: School!
LANE: Bye.
RORY: Bye.
RORY: Wow, Cinnamon, riding in style.
BABETTE: Yeah, Morey made it. Cinnamon's not walking good these days but she still likes her passeggiatas. That's Italian for 'a nice walk.'
MOREY: (with an accent) Passeggiata.
BABETTE: Oh God, he makes it sound so sexy.
MOREY: Come on.
LORELAI: (points to the covered area) What's that?
BABETTE: Oh it's Cinnamon's private area. Sometimes she likes to be alone. She's just like Morey in that sense. (to Morey) Hey, say passaggiata again.
MOREY: I can't do it on command, Babs.
BABETTE: Oh, he's blushin'. God, I love a man that blushes!
RORY: Okay, our town is just weird.
LORELAI: Thank God.
RORY: Bye.
LORELAI: Bye.
RORY: I'll see you later at school.
LORELAI: For what?
RORY: Mom, the bake sale!
LORELAI: Ha! I got the vein in the forehead. Whoo!
RORY: Sadist.
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Aah! Morning.
DEAN: Good book?
RORY: I don't know yet.
DEAN: I saw you standing in line so I thought I'd say hello. (pause) Hello?
RORY: Hello.
DEAN: Oh, hey, uh, thanks for helping me get the job at the store. I mean it's not a career or anything but it's got me solvent.
RORY: Solvent's good.
DEAN: Yeah, uh, are you always this serious?
RORY: No.
DEAN: So, uh, how long does it take you to get to school?
RORY: Um...forty minutes if the bus driver's focused but longer if he's trying to win something on the radio. Hey, this bus is going to Hartford!
DEAN: Yeah, I know.
RORY: But you go to school here. You have to get off the bus! (calls to driver) Hey, he has to get off the bus!
DEAN: Wait. You're forgetting something.
DEAN: Buses make stops. Good-bye Lorelai Gilmore.
MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking. Yes, you are confirmed. Mm-hmm. Goodbye.
MAN: Bonjour Monsieur. Vous êtes francais? Vous parlez francais?
MICHEL: No, sorry.
MAN: Parlez vous fracais?
MICHEL: Sir, I'm just a simple country boy from Texas. I do not understand this francais business you're babbling about.
LORELAI: Pardon
LORELAI: He knows you're not from Texas.
MICHEL: Smile when you say that.
LORELAI: Michel, I told you there was going to be a French group here for a couple of days and it is your job to keep them happy.
MICHEL: Lorelai, I don't know how many French people you've met over the years, but most of them are insufferable.
LORELAI: Really?
MICHEL: Mm-hm. That is why I left France.
LORELAI: Huh. I thought it had something to do with the torches and the villagers. Michel, talk to them.
MICHEL: Never. (pause) You are giving me that look aren't you? Your patented, "Do it or something unspeakable shall befall you" look. (sighs) Fine. I shall be French but I shall not be happy.
LORELAI: Then you will be yourself. Good choice.
MICHEL: Bonjour messieurs. Je m'appelle Miche. Ce soir pour vous aider.
MAN: (laughs) Vous avez faîtt un blague. Très drole! Très drole Michel!
MICHEL: (to Lorelai) Kill me now.
SOOKIE: OK-- we've got our French fantasies, American treats, and our Italian taste sensations. Well, what do you think?
RORY: Amazing.
LORELAI: Incredible.
SOOKIE: It is good, isn't it? Well, final touch.
RORY: Oh, can I do that?
SOOKIE: Whoa, honey, this is a more delicate procedure than you might think, OK?
RORY: OK.
SOOKIE: It takes an expert hand.
LORELAI: Um -- hi. Oh, well, gee...what is that, a dollar? Let me find you a dollar. You know what? I'll take two -- I'll drink one. (drinks) Mmm...tasty and flame-retardant.
LORELAI: Well we're not into subtle.
LORELAI: Good to see you, Mr. Medina.
LORELAI: Mr. Medina.
LORELAI: Mr. Medina. Meet Sookie, the cheft at the inn. Sookie, Mr. Medina.
SOOKIE: What's your name again?
LORELAI: Mr. Medina.
SOOKIE: I know, you've said it like a zillion times. (to Mr. Medina) Hello.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, sure. (to Sookie) Oh! Hey I'll be right back.
LORELAI: There's no ice.
LORELAI: No, that's not ice, it's wintry.
LORELAI: I know.
LORELAI: OK.
LORELAI: I appreciate that.
LORELAI: We are. Me too.
LORELAI: Yeah. Really, truly, I swear. There's no more ice. We're walking in a pool of tepid water.
LORELAI: Good.
LORELAI: Oh wow, intrigue.
LORELAI: Are you asking me out on a date.
LORELAI: Mm. Well, uh, I don't want to go out on a limb here, but I'm guessing if the headmaster won't let a kid be thirty seconds late for a test he'd probably frown on a teacher dating a mom.
LORELAI: Yeah but I'm guessing it's sort of an unwritten rule.
LORELAI: And Rory would probably freak at the thought.
LORELAI: And the other parents would have a field day with this kind of thing.
LORELAI: Yes.
LORELAI: Wait.
LORELAI: No.
LORELAI: I can't. It's wrong. It's weird.
LORELAI: You're on.
LORELAI: I'm kidding. I don't know. You're Rory's teacher.
LORELAI: Could you quit? Right, that's crazy.
LORELAI: Only with my oxygen.
LORELAI: I'm going to be in town tomorrow because I take a class at Hartford State and there's a coffee shop across the street that I sometimes, almost all the time, go to around 4:00 and usually exactly 4:12. I could not stop a person from entering said establishment around that time, nor would I avoid them if I knew them if they did.
LORELAI: See you around, Max.
LANE: Philadelphia.
RORY: Philadelphia? If you could live in any city in the world you'd pick Philadelphia?
LANE: M. Night Shymalan lives there.
RORY: Who?
LANE: The guy who directed 'The Sixth Sense.'
RORY: But what would you do there?
LANE: Hang out with M. Night Shymalan.
RORY: OK, cross 'guidance counselor' off your list of potential career choices.
BABETTE: Lie still, baby doll, we're almost home.
RORY: Hey Babette.
BABETTE: Hey kids.
RORY: Wow, that sounds bad.
BABETTE: Cinnamon's dyspeptic. So's Morey. Too many clams.
MOREY: Bad clams.
BABETTE: This doesn't reflect well on Al's establishment.
LANE: You had clams at Al's?
RORY: Al's Pancake World?
BABETTE: Yeah, well we had a coupon.
RORY: Hmmm.
RORY: Oh wow! The store! Hey, listen, I have to pick up some stuff, so --
LANE: What do you have to pick up?
RORY: Just some...stuff. So I'll talk to you later tonight.
LANE: I'll go in with you.
RORY: Why?
LANE: Because otherwise I'd have to go home.
RORY: Home is good.
LANE: My home?
RORY: Yeah, actually I don't have to go in.
LANE: OK. Then I guess I will go home.
RORY: Great! Go, bye.
LANE: Bye...freak.
RORY: Um, no, thanks.
RORY: Definitely.
RORY: Oh well, I just --
RORY: Patty! It's not like that. He's just a person.
RORY: A boy-type person.
RORY: I really don't even know him.
RORY: I don't.
RORY: Please don't say anything.
RORY: Thank you.
EMPLOYEE: Excuse me, ma'am, what are you doing?
EMPLOYEE: I assume that you're going to pay for the food you've consumed on the premises.
EMPLOYEE: I'm the new assistant manager here.
EMPLOYEE: Not from now on, I'm sorry.
EMPLOYEE: The next time you put something in that mouth that doesn't belong there, I'm going to remove it and then call the police.
CASHIER: Is this all you want, honey? A head of lettuce and a mouse trap?
RORY: That should do it.
DEAN: That's a couple of must-need items there.
CASHIER: $2.27.
RORY: I only have a dollar.
DEAN: I could loan you the rest.
RORY: Uh, no, I'll just take the lettuce.
DEAN: Perfect. You could use half of it for a salad then use the other half to clobber the mouse with.
DEAN: Paper or plastic?
RORY: I'm fine.
LORELAI: Max! Hi!
LORELAI: Absolutely! What are you drinking?
LORELAI: Plain coffee?
LORELAI: Wow, so it's been a tough outing for you, huh?
WAITRESS: What can I get you?
LORELAI: Coffee, please.
LORELAI: Here we most certainly are.
LORELAI: Away from the school.
LORELAI: These things do happen.
LORELAI: Should we cut the cute and just get right to it?
LORELAI: Why?
LORELAI: Well I want to be in the Bangles but that doesn't mean I quit my job and get a guitar and ruin my life to be a Bangle, does it?
LORELAI: Yeah, that's not the point.
LORELAI: I repeat my question: 'why should we date?'
LORELAI: I'm attracted to pie. It doesn't mean I feel the need to date pie.
LORELAI: Yes?
LORELAI: Wow! Round one and already tapped.
LORELAI: Yes I am.
LORELAI: Dated a lot of Chilton moms, huh?
LORELAI: Oh so you have things to hide in all aspects of your life -- very interesting.
LORELAI: Do you like rap music?
LORELAI: Me too. Italian food?
LORELAI: Me too. You just telling me what I want to hear?
LORELAI: I knew it!
LORELAI: Yeah but if you're telling me what you think I want to hear then I'm not really getting to know you.
LORELAI: Uh...
LORELAI: (seriously) Rory is my life. She's my pal, my everything. And I would never, ever do anything that would hurt her.
LORELAI: Don't say that! She's eight! She's eight and her favorite hobby is making necklaces out of gum wrappers.
LORELAI: This is gonna be sad isn't it?
LORELAI: It's gonna be sad.
LORELAI: Oh, going for Kleenex.
LORELAI: Maybe dinner wouldn't be so bad.
LORELAI: Just take the card.
LORELAI: Just use the card.
LORELAI: Hey, that story about your uncle -- is that true?
SOOKIE: Thank you.
LORELAI: Thank you. (to Sookie) Life is a funny funny thing, huh?
SOOKIE: Yeah I love that Jim Carrey.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Jim Carrey. He's just -- he's just -- funny.
LORELAI: He is funny but I didn't mean funny, funny. I'm being philosophical.
SOOKIE: Oh. Very serious face. Jean-Paul Sartre.
LORELAI: I can't talk to you with that face.
LUKE: How do you guys get any work done?
SOOKIE: So why is life such a funy thing?
LORELAI: I met this amazing guy.
SOOKIE: Goody!
LORELAI: Yeah there's goody stuff about it but there's baddy stuff too. He's a teacher at Chilton. Max -- you met him at the bake sale.
SOOKIE: Oh! He looked good.
LORELAI: Yeah. Right. He's so sexy and smart and funny and he likes coffee.
SOOKIE: God, he sounds perfect for you. Did you get onions?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: (calls to Luke in the kitchen) Hey Luke! You forgot the onions.
LORELAI: I'm just so mixed up though. You know this is a real crossroads kind of situation.It's like 'to perm or not to perm.' I'm really confused.
SOOKIE: For Heaven's sake. (Sookie goes around the counter to get the onions. She starts adding things -- onions and spices -- to the other customers' plates.)
SOOKIE: Go ahead, I'm still listening. You were about to perm your hair.
LORELAI: I just want to do the right thing.
SOOKIE: I'm not sure I see what the problem is.
LORELAI: Oh there are many problems. First -- I do not like to involve Rory in my personal life. I don't want her to have to deal with that. You know, I might bring some guy home and he might not be THE guy but then she gets all attached to him and then all of a sudden I decide that I don't like the way he eats or he hums incessantly or --
SOOKIE: Or the way he smacks his lips or how his hair isn't really his.
LORELAI: Yeah. And then I break up with him and then Rory is the one who gets hurt.
SOOKIE: I totally understand.
LORELAI: This guy is her teacher. I mean, there's no way to keep him out of her life. She sees him every day.
SOOKIE: (to a bearded customer) Are you the open-faced turkey?
JEB: Yep.
SOOKIE: OK, I added a little fresh lemon and a little cayanne pepper. You're gonna plotz! (to Lorelai) You od know that Rory's not a baby anymore.
LORELAI: I know, that's what he said. Maybe I'm being too serious, right? Maybe I should loosen the rules a bit. Plus, be great to get...you know.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: You know.
SOOKIE: No I don't.
LORELAI: You know...he knows.
SOOKIE: (to bearded customer) You know?
JEB: Yeah I know.
LUKE: Sookie!
SOOKIE: Hey. I was just looking for your paprika.
LUKE: What have I said about the counter?
SOOKIE: I know.
LUKE: How the counter is a sacred space. MY sacred space. You don't do yoga on the Dalai Lama's mat and you don't come behind my counter, period.
SOOKIE: I was trying to help.
LUKE: (to Lorelai) You bring her again and I want her on a leash. I mean it.
SOOKIE: He does make a damn find burger though.
LORELAI: He does at that. Alright I'm just going to keep it simple. I'll tell Rory. If there's even an ounce of weirdenss about it I'll cancel.
SOOKIE: You haven't told Rory yet?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Oops.
LORELAI: No, not oops. The timing hasn't been right. This is a very delicate, fragile situation. It's like one of your souffles. If you don't do it right it's a disaster.
SOOKIE: And you have to order it 45 minutes in advance.
LORELAI: Huh?
SOOKIE: My souffle.
LORELAI: Right, I wasn't but speaking directly about your souffle. I was speaking metaphorically.
SOOKIE: Oh so you don't like my souffles?
LORELAI: How DO we work together?
RORY: Mom you better come.
LORELAI: Honey, what's wrong?
RORY: It's Cinnamon.
LORELAI: Babette? Honey?
BABETTE: Oh, Lorelai. Come in, come in. She's gone. Cinnamon's gone.
LORELAI: I'm so sorry.
RORY: Is there anything I can do for you, Morey?
MOREY: This is life, Rory, it breaks your heart.
BABETTE: She looked like she was sleeping. I thought she was asleep so I nudged her and she didn't wake. I gave her a push and she rolled off the couch and since I waxed the floor she went shootin' across the room and then she knocked over the lamp and she still didn't move. I knew it was over. Oh, God, my baby.
MOREY: Tell me it wasn't the --
BABETTE: Oh, Morey, don't do this to yourself. He thinks it was the clams.
MOREY: She saw me eating them and she gave me that 'hey, man, what's up?' look and --
VET: It wasn't the clams. Morey, in human years this cat was 260 years old.
LORELAI: That's a good, long life.
VET: Listen, why don't you let me take her out to the van and then I'll get out of your way.
BABETTE: Oh, no, stay. All of you, please stay. Cinnamon would want you here.
RORY: We'll stay as long as you want.
MOREY: I'll never eat clams again.
RORY: Me either.
LANE: They said that they rolled her body into a lamp.
LANE: Did you laugh?
LANE: Did you want to?
RORY: But it's sad.
LANE: Yeah, it's sad.
MICHEL: Hello? Hello? Where is Lorelai? I'm dropping something off. Yoo-hoo, 'Hee-Haw' man, where is Lorelai Gilmore?
LORELAI: Hey, hey, hey. Thank you. I could not get back to the inn.
MICHEL: What, you are having a party and I was not invited?
LORELAI: Sweetie, it's not a party, it's a wake.
MICHEL: Oh, really? Who died?
LORELAI: Their cat.
MICHEL: You are mourning a cat?
LORELAI: Yes.
MICHEL: They lick their privates, these cats.
LORELAI: Not the comforting chitchat we're looking for here. Goodbye. I'll talk to you later. Thank you.
BABETTE: A little air, honey!
SOOKIE: Oh, Luke.
LUKE: Sookie.
SOOKIE: What'cha got in the bag?
LUKE: Bricks.
SOOKIE: Yeah, good one.
LORELAI: Oh, bless you both! Everyone's starved, come in.
LORELAI: OK, how should we do this?
SOOKIE: Well we need a flow for the room so there's no bottlenecks. People coming in, they're gonna want a beverage. Put 'em on the first table then the smaller hors d'oeuvres next to that, leaving one hand free to greet the people. Then, back there, set up plates and cutlery. First the salads, then the meat dishes, then desserts on the piano bench. How does that sound?
LUKE: Dig in!
DEAN: Oh, hi, wow. I wasn't expecting you.
RORY: Or me you. I mean, you, me. I mean, come in.
LORELAI: Do you know him?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: No?
RORY: Well, he goes to my old school, so I see him there sometimes but I go to Chilton now.
LORELAI: Thanks for the update.
RORY: You're welcome.
DEAN: Do you have a second?
RORY: No. I have gum.
DEAN: No, thanks, uh, look --
DEAN: Oh, sure. I'll see you later.
RORY: Mom? Isn't that --
LORELAI: Oh, no.
RORY: That's Mr. Medina.
LORELAI: Tonight's Thursday!
RORY: Well, am I in trouble? Did the school call or something?
LORELAI: No, no you're great. I -- um -- let me just come back in just one second.
RORY: Wait -- what's going on?
LORELAI: Let me tell you in a minute.
RORY: Tell me now.
LORELAI: Max is here --
RORY: Max?
LORELAI: Max is here to pick me up.
RORY: Pick you up for -- oh.
LORELAI: I'm gonna go talk to him real quick and I'm gonna be right back.
LORELAI: Hey!
LORELAI: Hi.
LORELAI: I know. I was at the neighbors' house.
LORELAI: I know it's totally last minute.
LORELAI: I just completely forgot about our date.
LORELAI: No you're memorable. I've been memorabling all week. It's just -- We had a little emergency.
LORELAI: No, Rory's fine. It's the neighbors' cat.
LORELAI: -- cat. She died.
LORELAI: This was a very fat, very beloved cat.
LORELAI: No, no, no. Wait. No, Max, you're not forcing anything on me. I am telling the truth about the cat.
LORELAI: Please don't read that much into this. Call me and we'll reschedule. I promise that's what I want.
LORELAI: Cross my heart and hope no other neighborhood pets die on that day.
LORELAI: Good.
LORELAI: Cinnamon.
LORELAI: Stupid cat! You couldn't have held on one more day?
SOOKIE: Is that meatloaf?
LUKE: Uh-huh.
SOOKIE: You use ketchup?
LUKE: You gonna make fun of my mother too?
SOOKIE: Sorry. You know, my real-fruit puffs would compliment that dish quite well.
LUKE: It's fine on its own, thank you.
SOOKIE: Right.
LUKE: OK, toss some on the plate.
SOOKIE: Can I make a pretty design, maybe make some layers?
LUKE: Sookie!
SOOKIE: Right. Tossing them on. Got it.
LORELAI: You guys, have you seen Rory anywhere?
LUKE: Yeah, I think she headed that way. (points)
LORELAI: OK, thanks.
EMPLOYEE: Excuse me, ma'am?
EMPLOYEE: I want to apologize for what happened at the store yesterday.
EMPLOYEE: I wasn't aware that you were THE Miss Patty. The owner tells me that you're one of our best customers and you can put anything into that mouth that you want to. Those were his words. I could have paraphrased them.
EMPLOYEE: Thank you.
LORELAI: Hey, Babette.
BABETTE: Oh, hello, sugar. Can I get you something?
LORELAI: No, I'm fine. I'm looking for Rory.
BABETTE: Oh, I think she might be in the bathroom.
LORELAI: Thanks. (starts to leave then stops) Can I help you with something?
BABETTE: Oh, no. I thought I'd just get some of this stuff packed away.
LORELAI: It's like a scene from a kitty version of 'Valley of the Dolls.'
BABETTE: Yeah. You never realize how old they actually are 'til you look in the medicine cabinet.
LORELAI: Yeah.
BABETTE: These were for her heartworms, for her thyroid, her kidneys, for the rash she got from taking these, and these were for the tic she developed from the stuff for the rash. And these -- oh jeez, these are mine. Damn, I'm gonna miss that old broad.
LORELAI: I know.
BABETTE: You know, I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself now. You live to take care of your kids.
LORELAI: I know, sweetie, but you gave her everything that you had.
BABETTE: I know. She was so tiny when I got her. She could sleep in my shoe.
LORELAI: The other day I came across a hat that I made for Rory. It was like a doll hat.
BABETTE: Oh, they grow up so fast.
LORELAI: And then they take your clothes.
BABETTE: I guess eventually you have to move on. Figure out what your life is going to be when you're not busy taking care of somebody else. Jeez, look at this place. Not a clean glass in sight!
LORELAI: Let me help you with that.
BABETTE: Here, sugar, use this. Morey sits on it when he helps me.
LORELAI: How does Morey get around in here?
BABETTE: Oh, just fine. He had a couple of concussions his first year here but he never complains. He's just the best thing. I don't know what I'd do without him. (voice breaks)
LORELAI: Oh, Babette. What do you mean 'without him'?
BABETTE: I saw on Oprah a few weeks ago. She had on couples who lost a child. Most of the marriages went belly-up for the pain of it all. Even though they loved each other.
LORELAI: Babette, that is not gonna happen to you.
BABETTE: I never thought a man would ever even want me.
LORELAI: I know the feeling.
BABETTE: Oh, please, with that ass? Gimme a break.
LORELAI: I mean want me for more than my ass. Me -- for me, the whole package. Annoying neuroses and all.
BABETTE: You'll find him. It might even be that stud who drove out of here in a Mustang.
LORELAI: Did you see him?
BABETTE: Yeah, what a jaw.
LORELAI: He's got a great jaw.
BABETTE: How is he in the sack?
LORELAI: I haven't even gone out with him yet.
BABETTE: Will you tell me when how he is when you do?
LORELAI: I'll call you during the cigarette.
BABETTE: Oh -- that's Cinnamon's song.
LORELAI: Oh I can't find Rory anywhere.
SOOKIE: I'm sure she's around.
LORELAI: Max showed up for the date that I forgot about and she saw him.
SOOKIE: And you haven't told her.
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Oops.
LORELAI: Stop with the 'oops.'
SOOKIE: OK, calm down. It's not that big of a deal.
LORELAI: Her teacher showed up on her porch to take out her mother.
SOOKIE: She'll understand. You're crazy. She knows that.
LORELAI: Enough with the comforting, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Sorry.
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Jeez, you scared me.
DEAN: Yeah, uh, look. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
RORY: For what?
DEAN: Well I've been kind of bugging you lately. Uh, I thought -- I don't know -- I thought that maybe you liked me. But it's obvious that you're not interested so I just wanted to say that I get it and I'm not gonna bother you anymore.
RORY: Wait! I AM interested.
DEAN: You are?
RORY: Yes. I gotta go.
LORELAI: Oh! Finally. I've been looking everywhere for you.
RORY: Well you found me.
LORELAI: Listen, I have some explaining to do. OK. So sit down in that tiny little chair and I'm gonna do it right now. (Rory sits.) That man on the porch was your teacher.
RORY: Mom, I'm a little behind in school but not so far behind that I don't know who the teacher is. So?
LORELAI: So -- um -- he and I were going to sort of hang out together.
RORY: On a date.
LORELAI: No, on a -- something that could appear like a date to the untrained eye.
RORY: To your daughter's eye?
LORELAI: It was a date.
RORY: How long have you been dating him?
LORELAI: I haven't. This was gonna be the first time.
RORY: And when were you planning on telling me about this -- your wedding?
LORELAI: No -- by the rehearsal dinner at least.
RORY: He's my teacher.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: He teaches me things every day in a very small classroom with a lot of other kids who probably won't be high-fiving me when they find this out.
LORELAI: I knw, sweetie, and I told him this was one of the things I was concerned about.
RORY: And?
LORELAI: And he thought we could be discreet.
RORY: Unbelievable!
LORELAI: Are you mad?
RORY: Yes!
LORELAI: Alright. Because I'm dating him?
RORY: Because you lied to me.
LORELAI: I kept information from you.
RORY: Information that I should have had.
LORELAI: Information that would have come out eventually. Like the Iran-Contra scandal.
RORY: So you're Oliver North.
LORELAI: No, I'm Fawn Hall.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Well, she was much prettier.
RORY: I just can't believe that you didn't tell me about this. Why wouldn't you tell me?
LORELAI: 'Cause I thought you were going to take it bad. Thank God I was wrong. (pause) OK, OK. Listen, I'm sorry. I won't date him. I promise.
RORY: I'm not saying that you can't date him. It's just -- this is weird. I mean -- there's a million guys in this world and you end up with Mr. Medina.
LORELAI: You think I don't get the weirdness factor? Believe me, the last thing I intended to do was date your teacher.
RORY: I believe you.
LORELAI: I really like him, Rory. I can't help it. And it's been a really long time since I've felt like this. You can't always control who you're attracted to, you know. I think the whole Angelina Jolie/Billy Bob Thronton thing really proves that. And I know you don't understand this now but you wil someday. You'll meet some great guy and he'll make your head all foggy and you won't know what to do with yourself. (sighs) Oh, sweetie, I won't keep anything from you again. OK? I promise. From now on every aspect of my life is an open book to you.
RORY: That's OK.
LORELAI: Really, I'm not even going to get dressed until I tell you what I'm thinking of wearing.
RORY: Fair enough.
LORELAI: OK, tomorrow I'm thinking the purple tiger top, the black leather skirt, the panda bear underwear.
RORY: Oh, good.
LORELAI: But of course I'm totally open to suggestions.
RORY: Here's one: get some help.
LORELAI: Let us know if we can do anything.
BABETTE: Oh, you've done too much already.
LORELAI: Good-night, Babette.
BABETTE: Good-night, sugar.
RORY: Good-night, Morey.
MOREY: Stay cool, Rory.
BABETTE: It's getting late.
MOREY: Let's stay outside a while, baby. Look for the Big Dipper.
BABETTE: OK, I'd like that.
LORELAI: Hello.
EMILY: I've been trying to get you all afternoon.
LORELAI: Mom?
EMILY: Yes.
LORELAI: Hi.
EMILY: You already said that.
LORELAI: But someone hasn't.
EMILY: Hello.
LORELAI: There we go.
EMILY: You are impossible to reach.
LORELAI: Well there's no messages on the machine, Mom.
EMILY: I don't leave messages. If I wanted to talk to a machine I'd talk to my VCR. Where were you?
LORELAI: At a wake.
EMILY: A what?
LORELAI: A wake...a funeral.
EMILY: A funeral? Whose?
LORELAI: It was for the neighbors' --
LORELAI: -- cat.
LORELAI: Mom?
EMILY: Hold on. I'm looking up anyuresm in our medical dictionary to see if I just had one.
LORELAI: I just wanted to be honest with you, Mom. Silly me.
EMILY: A cat?
LORELAI: Yeah, a cat. It was a cat's funeral.
EMILY: You skipped your own cousin's funeral for a cat's funeral?
LORELAI: Not my cousin, mom. My father's grandmother's sister's girl who I've never --
EMILY: You said you couldn't be away from the inn.
LORELAI: Well I couldn't at the time bt I worked it out.
EMILY: For a cat?
LORELAI: It's late. I have a big day tomorrow, Mom.
EMILY: Oh, what? You're going to a racoon's wedding?
LORELAI: Good-night, Mother.
EMILY: Good-night.
LORELAI: Aaagh! She's working for a sedative manufacturer. Keeping that demand sky-high.
RORY: You shouldn't have told her.
LORELAI: Well I don't know what to tell and what to hide.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: So we never did quite settle the whole dating-your-teacher issue. I won't go out with him if you don't want me to.
RORY: You can go out with whoever you want.
LORELAI: It's whoever we want.
RORY: Well I'm certainly not going to go out with him 'cause that would be really weird.
LORELAI: But I mean it. I won't see him if you don't want me to.
RORY: Huh.
LORELAI: You know, if there's anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, big or small, then he's out of there.
RORY: Good to know.
LORELAI: Because you know it's not like I'm desperate. I mean, there are plenty of other guys out there.
RORY: Sure are.
LORELAI: And it's not like I have to ask your permission. I mean, this is a courtesy.
RORY: OK.
LORELAI: OK, so I'm going to be up for a while, if you want to get back to me on this.
RORY: I know where you are.
RORY: Hey, do you think you could keep him out really late on Thursday night because I have this oral exam on Friday that I'd really love him to sleep through.
LORELAI: I'll do my best.
